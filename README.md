# Coloury (Project named Alice)

Coloury is software that helps you to manage color patterns in your digital artwork. I started this project (project named "Alice") in 2023 using Apple Swift language under Xcode. Coloury has become an open-source project helping you learn about or understand color compositing ([like Adobe Kuler](https://color.adobe.com/zh/create/color-wheel).) and sampling. I hope you enjoy it.


## Indroduction
Coloury is a color management and creation software, and you may sample colors from an image or set up color compositions from a color wheel. The generated color scheme can be shared or exported to designing or painting software you are familiar with（Such as Procreate or PhotoShop）. You may apply the colors to your artwork, such as poster design, digital painting, or rich text document writing.

### Features:

-   #### Sampling

    Sampling colors from an image is one of the key features of Coloury. Coloury generates a color scheme from the region you specified in an image, containing the dominant colors in that area.

-   #### Composing

    You may compose colors from a color wheel in Coloury. Coloury supports several color composition modes from an Artist Color Wheel(similar to Itten's Pattern), such as Analogous, Monochromatic, Triad, etc.

-   #### Applying colors for your artwork

    Coloury supports two popular swatches file formats, "Adobe Extension Swatches" and "Procreate Swatches," you may export colors to the software you are familiar with, which supports these two swatches file formats, applying the colors to your artwork.

-   #### Analyzing

    Coloury provides a color scheme diagram to let you analyze the color composition. You may examine the digital values of the scheme in six color model values: "HEX," "RGB," "RYB," "HSL," "HSB," and "CMYK."

-   #### Portrait

    The portrait is an image with a designed layout that describes the dominant colors of a image, it looks like a sugar function that lets you share artworks to friends.
